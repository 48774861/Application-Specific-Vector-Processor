The objective of this project is to design and implement an optimized, special purpose arithmetic unit that processes a set of three data vectors a, b, d with each vector comprising four components. The mathematical operation to be implemented is shown by the following equations: (1) c = a x b, (2) e = c + d, and finally (3) f = e - (256xb). Each vector, a, b, c, d, e, and f is a vector of four components and each component represents a fixed-point signed value in 2’s complement form. The design is I/O limited since it only has a single 8-bit input data bus and a single 8-bit output bus. Since a total of twelve input values are required to perform the calculation (four fixed- point signed integers that each different components for the vectors a, b, and c), twelve clock cycles are required to receive the full data set for a single computation. Truncated 8-bit arithmetic is used, so only the most significant eight bits of the arithmetic result will be present in the four different 8-bit output values of vector f. The design should have a MAXIMUM initiation rate of 13 clock cycles and a MAXIMUM latency of 15 clock cycles.
